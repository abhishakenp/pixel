# Pixel architecture

This document describes how the workspace is put together: the crates, the
data that lives on disk, the daemon wire contract, and the paths a command
takes from the CLI to an answer. It is the map a contributor (human or agent)
should read before touching more than one crate.

For what Pixel does and why, read `README.md`. For per-turn project rules,
read `AGENTS.md`.

```

Everything below the CLI is a library crate. Only `crates/pixel` builds a
binary, and Pixel is deliberately a CLI plus hooks and extensions, not an
MCP server. `pixel install` registers no MCP server with any agent.

## Crates

| Crate | Role | Depends on (pixel crates) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pixel-cli` (bin `pixel`, in `crates/pixel`) | Command-line surface. Parses argv with clap, talks to the daemon or runs the service in-process, prints text or JSON. Also hosts the hook entry points under `run-hook` (alias `hook`: `guard`, `composed-guard`, `session-start`, `prompt-submit`, `post-compaction`, `post-tool-use`, `metrics`), `rescue`, `recall`, and `sniper` sub-commands. | every library crate except `pixel-context` (reached through the daemon) and `pixel-bench` |
| `pixel-proto` | The shared contract crate: `Envelope`, `PixelError` and `ErrorCode`, `Epistemics`, `SnapshotInfo`, `Budget`, `Warning`, the `Op` request enum, and `commands::RENAMED_COMMANDS`, the old-to-new CLI subcommand names the CLI accepts as hidden aliases until 1.0. No I/O, no business logic. Every other crate that speaks the wire format depends on it, and it depends on nothing internal. | none |
| `pixel-daemon` | Transport-agnostic `Service` (`api.rs`) and the Unix-socket NDJSON daemon with filesystem watching (`daemon.rs`). Dispatches each `Op` to the right library, attaches snapshot and epistemics metadata, and is the one place a retrieval envelope is built. Also hosts the recall daemon service. | index, graph, context, rank, proto, ops, facts, session, recall, git |
| `pixel-index` | Sparse n-gram (trigram) text index: gram extraction, window weighting, posting-list algebra, git-anchored base and delta shards, working-tree overlay, query planner, verification, and the `gitsync` helpers that read HEAD, branch, and porcelain status. | git |
| `pixel-graph` | Code graph: tree-sitter extraction of symbols, imports, and call sites per file; import resolution; tiered call resolution with an epistemic envelope; and the analyses `impact`, `trace`, `process`, `cluster`, `changes`, `targets`. `store` owns the SQLite schema. | git, index |
| `pixel-facts` | History-wide fact and diff ingest, search, lifecycle, and rescue discovery. Owns `history.db`: commit metadata, diff text, and contentless FTS5 trigram indexes over the diffs and paths. Demand-driven: the daemon never ingests at startup, and `status` and `doctor` never create the db — the first history query runs a bounded catch-up (`PIXEL_FACTS_QUERY_BUDGET_MS`, default 3 s) and spawns the low-priority keep-fresh loop that never blocks queries. Bounded: diff text is kept for the last 365 days (`PIXEL_HISTORY_WINDOW_DAYS`, `0` for all) within 256 MiB of used pages (`PIXEL_HISTORY_BUDGET_MB`), newest first; older diffs are evicted, metadata never is. `build-index --history` remains the explicit full build. Backs `excavate`, `lifecycle`, `history-search` and `rescue` discovery (`resolve` is the graph's concept index). | git |
| `pixel-rank` | Fusion core for `targets` and ranked `search`: task text and signal inputs in, closed prioritized P0/P1/P2 file list out. The scoring is pure; `compute_signals` gathers the activity channel itself (git log churn when facts have none, and a failed or capped scan is reported as unavailable rather than as an empty map) and takes the session and error-sink channels from its caller — the daemon feeds neither of those. | graph, git, session |
| `pixel-context` | Semantic compression of code-context items: layered renderings that fit a token budget instead of raw source dumps. | none |
| `pixel-ops` | Safe git mutation infrastructure ported from usable-git: snapshot store, repository lock, operation journal, recovery keys. Implements `inspect`, `review`, `history`, `diff`, `publish`, `push`, `ship`, `branch`, `update`, `sync`, `reconcile`, `rewrite`, `provenance`, `branches`, `env`. | git |
| `pixel-git` | The single git subprocess wrapper for the workspace. Replaced three earlier ad-hoc wrappers. Any crate that shells out to git goes through `GitRunner` (timeout, output cap, redacted stderr); `crates/pixel-git/tests/boundary.rs` fails the build on a `Command::new("git")` in any other crate's non-test code. | none |
| `pixel-recall` | Machine-wide LLM transcript retrieval: ingests Claude Code, Codex, opencode, pi, Devin, Cursor, zcode, and Gemini transcript stores into one SQLite corpus, then serves lexical and semantic search. Demand-driven: nothing scans transcripts until a recall query runs — the in-process path then catches up per agent (last week cold, since-last-ingest warm, capped at 30 days; `recall index` for the full history). Owns the embedding backends (`fastembed` ONNX and pure-Rust `model2vec`, both behind features) and the `search-meaning` code chunker, which reuses the graph's tree-sitter extraction. | graph, index, rank |
| `pixel-session` | One-look error capture: every error from every layer lands at throw time in one structured local SQLite sink, queryable in one call. | git |
| `pixel-actionlog` | Append-only local JSONL invocation records: measured command/outcome/duration/output volume plus versioned workflow estimates; backwards-compatible `pixel action-log` and `pixel token-savings` reporting. | none |
| `pixel-task` | Durable completion contracts, deterministic workflow gates, source manifests, private verification receipts, measured task trajectories, pure policy replay, and explicit controlled evaluation. | git, ops |
| `pixel-release` | `pixel check-release`: the consistency checks a release tag must pass (CLI version, `Cargo.lock` freshness, changelog cut). Pure functions over file contents. | none |
| `pixel-flow` | Deterministic browser and configuration flow replay: save, get, list, revise, replay, delete proven agent-browser paths. Flows live under `~/.local/share/pixel/flows/`. | none |
| `pixel-install` | Idempotent `pixel install`, `pixel uninstall`, `pixel doctor`. Global install: the bundled prompts, Claude Code lifecycle hooks (removing the retired `claude()` shell wrapper), the Codex `developer_instructions` key plus `UserPromptSubmit` and metrics hooks, the Pi `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` block, and, when their config exists, the OpenCode `AGENTS.md` block, the Antigravity plugin and hooks, Devin's own lifecycle hooks (`~/.config/devin/config.json` — Devin imports Claude's hooks, so without them its sessions get the imported Claude text instead of its own protocol), and the zcode guard. `--repo`: project guards for Claude, Codex, Devin and Pi, and the Pixel-first `AGENTS.md` rule (see "Agent integration"). Backs up changed files (`<file>.pixel-bak.<nanos>-<seq>` beside each); `uninstall` keeps those backups and ends on a `backups` step listing them with the quoted `rm --` command that drops them. | proto, daemon, index, facts, git |
| `pixel-ultraflow` | The classify-driven browser loop over saved flows: the observation (`agent-browser snapshot -i` parsed into numbered slots, `elements`), the indexed action space of operation-target pairs (`action`), the decision seam (`decide`), the discovery loop and its single-cycle unit (`discover`), the composition of what worked into a `pixel-flow` document whose `conditional` steps carry the conditions that tell its branches apart (`compose`), and the replay that decides those conditions with `pixel classify` and re-decides a step whose page moved on (`replay`). Drives `pixel-flow`'s browser seam; the engine is a trait, so the whole loop is tested without a model, a network or a page. | flow |
| `pixel-bench` | Criterion benches and a real-source corpus builder (gram extraction, latency, NDCG relevance). Not shipped. | index (dev: daemon, graph, proto, recall) |

Dependency rule: `pixel-proto` and `pixel-git` are leaves (so are `pixel-context`, `pixel-actionlog`, `pixel-flow`, `pixel-ultraflow` (which depends on `pixel-flow` alone) and `pixel-release`; `pixel-session` depends on `pixel-git` only). `pixel-daemon` is
the integration point and is the only library crate allowed to depend on
almost everything. The CLI depends on the daemon plus whatever it needs for
commands that never touch the daemon (install, flow, actionlog, release-check).

## Command surface

Every subcommand of the built binary, one line each, in `pixel --help`
order. `crates/pixel/tests/cli/docs_drift.rs` fails when a command listed
by `--help` is missing here, or when any `` `pixel <name>` `` in README,
ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, `docs/manual-setup.md`, the site's `website/content/docs.md` and `benchmarks.md`, or the bundled agent prompts
(`crates/pixel-install/assets/pixel-agent-prompt.md`,
`pixel-subagent-prompt.md`) names a command the binary does not have. The 45 names renamed after 0.2.4 still parse as hidden aliases until 1.0 (table in `pixel_proto::commands::RENAMED_COMMANDS`, README "Renamed commands"); `--help` and this table list only the current names.

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `pixel build-index` | Build (or rebuild) the text index for a directory tree |
| `pixel search-content` | Search the indexed tree with a regex pattern. |
| `pixel search-like-rg` | Native-output literal file search for automatic routing; unsupported inputs execute the original rg/grep command without modification |
| `pixel run-recipe` | Compile and execute one bounded deterministic retrieval recipe |
| `pixel search-meaning` | Semantic code search: embed a natural-language question ("how is authentication handled?") and rank files by fusing semantic and BM25 lexical ranks over symbol chunks (tree-sitter symbols with their doc comments, windows for unparsed files); tests, configuration/data and docs are weighted below code unless the question names them. |
| `pixel scope-task` | Sniper target list: task description in, closed prioritized file list out (P0 = start here, P1 = likely, P2 = droppable). `--read-only` instead returns a typed deterministic fact envelope only from a compatible running daemon; it never starts a daemon, builds/refreshes indexes, or writes the targets manifest. |
| `pixel plan-rollback` | Surgical revert planner: locate the files a problem points at, list recent versions with the likely-breaking commit flagged, recommend a last-known-good candidate. |
| `pixel ai-cli-readify` | Provider readiness for the four agent CLIs (Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, Devin): probe Ollama Cloud, then probe each agent in its own lane, reporting an agent blocked when the provider did not answer; `--apply` points the agents' configs at the provider that answered; `--approve --workspace <dir>` clears the named folder's startup gate through Codex's own `config/batchWrite` RPC and Claude's `~/.claude.json`. |
| `pixel find-symbol` | Look up symbols by name in the code graph |
| `pixel list-signatures` | All signatures in a file — the skeleton view at ~10% of Read cost |
| `pixel note` | Human notes on the map: durable annotations keyed by file + symbol name (or concept norm). |
| `pixel repo-map` | Structural repo map: every indexed file with its symbols. |
| `pixel pack-context` | Budget-fitted context for a symbol uid |
| `pixel impact` | Blast radius of a symbol (callers upstream / callees downstream) |
| `pixel who-calls` | Direct callers or callees of a symbol |
| `pixel rename` | IDE-style symbol rename: graph-resolved definition, call, reference, and import sites, each verified against a fresh tree-sitter parse before writing; unresolved same-name sites are reported, never guessed. `--dry-run` prints the edit set without touching files |
| `pixel call-path` | Call path between two symbols; its `successor` field names the `pixel evaluate path` command that asks the same question with a bounded answer |
| `pixel evaluate` | Bounded predicate evaluation with a witness: does a path exist between two symbols in the indexed call graph, with the snapshot the answer is about, an exhaustive-traversal absence, or a typed reason for not answering |
| `pixel list-flows` | Discovered execution flows |
| `pixel list-areas` | Functional-area clusters |
| `pixel what-changed` | Symbols/flows affected by working-tree changes |
| `pixel rebuild-graph` | Force (re)build of the code graph db |
| `pixel workspace` | Multi-repo registry (`.pixel/workspace.json` members add/remove/list); `--workspace` fans `impact`/`who-calls` out across registered repos with per-repo provenance |
| `pixel index-pack` | Freeze the index into one checksummed `.pxpack` bundle — CI builds once, teammates install instead of re-indexing |
| `pixel index-unpack` | Install a packed index bundle from a path or https:// URL, hash-verified, refusing to overwrite a live index without `--force` |
| `pixel status` | Index + graph freshness status |
| `pixel coverage` | Per-language index coverage: files on disk vs files indexed, with unrecognized extensions surfaced — the "what did the index miss?" answer |
| `pixel audit` | What an agent reads to learn what the largest source files contain: each whole file against its `list-signatures` outline in tokens (bytes / 4, floored), the total and the per-file median, files changed since indexing or with no signatures left out and counted, then per-language coverage. Builds the graph on a first run only; local, read-only, sends nothing |
| `pixel prepare-repo` | Make a repository ready for agent work: index, graph, and warm daemon |
| `pixel index-stats` | Show raw shard metadata (legacy) |
| `pixel daemon` | Manage the per-root background daemon |
| `pixel recall` | Search and browse LLM CLI transcripts (machine-wide corpus) |
| `pixel list-errors` | One-look error capture: query the sniper error sink |
| `pixel classify` | Zero-shot decision over a bounded label set. Engines: `remote` (default; an OpenAI-compatible chat completion — `--remote-preset openrouter\|ollama\|local\|deepseek\|opencode-go` picks the endpoint and key variable, `--remote-model` the model; probabilities are verbalized, renormalized to sum 1) or `ollaya` (`--engine ollaya --ollaya-url …`: a local Ollaya decision daemon's native typed-choice readout, TypeSafe-compatible `/v1/systemone`, with calibrated confidence disclosed in the snapshot). Without `--engine` the stored preference decides (`pixel config classify-engine local\|remote\|auto`; `pixel install` proposes it with each option's accuracy), probing the local daemon and falling back to remote. Output always discloses `snapshot.deterministic=false` and `snapshot.provider`. `--context` keeps shared framing out of the state. State, context and criteria are capped separately with disclosure. Without `--label`, the local engine answers the default question battery (Ollaya's `triage` preset: `choice`/`score`/`noul` typed answers) instead of a single decision — the remote engine still requires labels. No pixel daemon; `--jsonl` serves one decision per stdin line. `--task-intent` judges the text with the built-in coding-task labels (bugfix, feature, refactor, investigate, question, review, ops) and adds the fitting pixel ops (`next:` / `next_ops`); `--if-warm` answers only from a local engine already listening — never starts it, never falls back to remote — and otherwise exits 1 with empty stdout. The Claude prompt hook asks the same `--task-intent` question itself (local daemon warm, `classify.enabled` on, 300 ms cap) and adds the verdict to the `[PIXEL:TASK_RUNTIME v1]` packet as a classifier claim |
| `pixel web-search` | Deterministic web lookup for terms the index cannot know — the refine step of a gated `pixel plan`. SearXNG alone when `PIXEL_WEB_SEARCH_URL` is set; otherwise DuckDuckGo, then Wikipedia while the hits are fewer than `--limit`. No LLM, no daemon |
| `pixel repo-state` | Show repo state: HEAD, branch, dirty files, fingerprints; `--include-clean` adds the capped tracked-clean list |
| `pixel review-changes` | Review working-tree changes (staged, unstaged, untracked, conflicted) |
| `pixel review-gate` | Deterministic pre-review: `what-changed` plus the mechanical rules — credential-shaped added lines, and changed symbols whose callers were not themselves changed — each finding carrying its witness; the caps it fired ride the epistemics envelope |
| `pixel commit-history` | Commit history with detail levels and byte caps |
| `pixel diff` | Structured diff between two refs (or ref → working tree) |
| `pixel commit` | Stage files, commit, and optionally push (crash-safe, idempotent) |
| `pixel push` | Leased push to a remote (crash-safe, idempotent) |
| `pixel commit-and-push` | Publish + push in one op (commit then leased push) |
| `pixel new-branch` | Create a new branch from HEAD (or --from <ref>) |
| `pixel fast-forward` | Fast-forward merge to a target OID (refuses non-ff + dirty intersection) |
| `pixel fetch` | Fetch from a remote (idempotent) |
| `pixel find-code` | Engine 1: resolve a phrase to code via the concept index |
| `pixel search-history` | M3: history-wide fact + diff search |
| `pixel file-history` | Engine 2: lifecycle of a path or token |
| `pixel dig-history` | Engine 2: history-wide discovery (rescue v2) |
| `pixel sync-branch` | Engine 4: one-call deterministic branch sync |
| `pixel record-event` | M5: journal a session event (fire-and-forget) |
| `pixel install` | Idempotently deploy the agent prompt, the Claude shell wrapper, the Codex developer_instructions config key and — when `~/.config/opencode` exists — the managed prompt block in OpenCode's global `AGENTS.md` |
| `pixel uninstall` | Remove everything `pixel install` wrote: managed blocks from agent-config files, hook entries from all settings files, hook scripts, the pi guard extension, the rule source file, and the pixel binary itself. |
| `pixel check-release` | Check that a release tag is consistent with the tree before anything is built or published: crates/pixel/Cargo.toml carries the version, Cargo.lock is fresh for every workspace member, CHANGELOG.md has the `## [x.y.z]` heading and an empty Unreleased section. |
| `pixel self-update` | Rebuild the binary, stop the daemon, copy the new binary to the install path, and optionally restart the daemon. |
| `pixel doctor` | Health check: install state, daemon, index/graph/facts freshness |
| `pixel run-hook` | Hook entrypoints (guard, session-start, metrics relay) invoked by agent hooks |
| `pixel config` | Show effective settings and their sources; `setup` offers guided terminal configuration (also offered on interactive global install); `classify on\|off` controls the global classify kill switch (disabled by default); `edit [--repo]` opens commented YAML in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`. Global `~/.pixel/config.yaml`, repository `.pixel/config.yaml`; legacy JSON remains supported. |
| `pixel task-state` | Alias `task`: begin, contract, prepare, verify, review, finish, status, events, route, replay, evaluate, cancel and recover a durable task; show/reset retain the Claude packet interface |
| `pixel action-log` | Self-assessment: pixel's own action log (what ran, what went wrong). |
| `pixel token-savings` | Token-savings report: for retrieval-shaped commands (search/query/ context/resolve) that recorded snippet-vs-pool volumes, aggregate the fraction of the candidate pool the agent did NOT have to read. |
| `pixel squash-branch` | Squash every commit on the current branch since its base into ONE commit (crash-safe, backup-ref'd), optionally force-pushing with lease |
| `pixel who-wrote` | Per-region blame attribution: who introduced/owns each region of a file |
| `pixel list-branches` | One-call read-only branch inventory: ahead/behind, merged, stale, unpushed — the deterministic "did you push everything?" answer |
| `pixel edit-env` | Additive-only, key-level .env mutations with snapshots and restore. |
| `pixel plan` | Deterministic todo list generation from code analysis; emits blocking verification gates (auth session, env keys, provider keys, real DB state) detected in the plan's file set; persists findings in `.pixel/plan.json` so `--status`/`--done N`/`--undone N`/`--prune` track execution state across re-plans without the daemon |
| `pixel ultraflow` | The classify-driven browser loop over saved flows. `discover --url --goal` asks `pixel classify` one question per cycle whose options are the operation-target pairs the page currently offers, so one answer is one executable action; a typed field is filled from a declared `--var` or from a string the goal itself contains, never from an invented value. What worked composes into a `pixel flow` document under the flow store (`--save`), and `--repeat N` records a `conditional` where two runs diverged, worded so the branch is a page condition rather than a position. `replay <name>` follows that document, deciding each `conditional` and the flow's success signal with `pixel classify` (the text matcher is the disclosed fallback), and re-decides a step whose page no longer matches — `--update` records the new branch into the flow, so the next replay is deterministic where this one had to think. Drives `agent-browser --session comet`, the session `pixel flow run` uses. Each question is bounded by the *engine's* option budget, not the schema ceiling (`Decider::option_budget`: the local `winnow:e4b` accepts 64 labels, measured — a page with more controls has its tail reported in the trace rather than dropped quietly) |
| `pixel flow` | Save, retrieve, list, revise, run, and replay proven agent-browser paths (auth flows, config flows) so the agent follows a deterministic shortcut instead of re-discovering the UI from scratch every time. `run <name>` drives agent-browser with the plain executor; for a classify-decided replay with repair, use `pixel ultraflow replay` |
| `pixel help` | Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s). |

## On-disk state

Per repository, under `.pixel/` (git-ignored):

| Path | Owner | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base.shard`, `delta.shard`, `state.json`, `build.lock` | `pixel-index` | Base shard for all tracked files at a pinned commit, delta shard for files changed between that commit and HEAD, and `state.json` as the delta-layer sidecar (tombstones for superseded base paths). The dirty working-tree overlay is in memory only. First process to hold `build.lock` builds; others wait. |
| `graph.v2.db` | `pixel-graph` | SQLite: files, symbols, edges with resolution tier. Built lazily on first graph command. The name moves with the schema (`pixel_daemon::api::GRAPH_DB_FILE`); user-facing messages still say `graph.db`. |
| `history.db` (+ `-wal`, `-shm`, `history.db.lock`) | `pixel-facts` | SQLite: commit facts, diff text, lifecycle, FTS5 trigram indexes. Populated by `pixel build-index --history` or the daemon ingest thread on the first history query; capped by the window and budget above, with `auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL` so an eviction shrinks the file. Schema version `FACTS_SCHEMA_VERSION` (3) in `PRAGMA user_version`: another version is rebuilt, except 2 (`UPGRADES_IN_PLACE_FROM`), whose dates are repaired in place. |
| `code-vectors/` (`manifest.json`, `seg-*.vec`, `lock`) | `pixel-recall` | `search-meaning` chunk vectors, keyed by the xxh3-128 hash of the chunk text seeded with the model id, embedder revision and `CHUNKER_VERSION`; stored as the model's `f32`s. Written only when the search root carries `base.shard` and is not `$HOME`, never by the daemon's semantic fallback. `flock` on `lock` (shared to read, exclusive to write), segments immutable, the manifest replaced by rename; rewritten with the live rows once unreachable ones exceed a quarter of them. |
| `targets.json` | CLI `targets` | Active task map (version 2): tasks with ids, timestamps, and P0/P1/P2 paths. Read by the guard hook and re-injected after compaction. |
| `actions.jsonl` | `pixel-actionlog` | One line per invocation, with the route and phase timings of each request it served (`serve`). |
| `reconcile-conflict.json`, `env-snapshots/` | `pixel-ops` | Conflict marker left by `reconcile` for the guard, and the pre-mutation copies `env` takes. |
| `calls.json` | CLI | Circuit breaker counters for repeated identical calls. |
| `task-runtime.json` | CLI `task-state show/reset` and Claude hooks | Existing bounded Claude context packets; independent of completion evidence. |
| `tasks/<id>/journal.jsonl`, `tasks/<id>/task.json`, `tasks/<id>/lock`, `tasks/<id>/run-<run_id>.json` | `pixel-task` | Authoritative checksummed task transactions and a rebuildable view, serialized by task lock; verification leases record child ownership for interruption recovery. Legacy v1 records migrate as unverified. |
| `tasks/source-manifests/<content_id>.json`, `tasks/source-cache.json`, `tasks/session-locks/`, `tasks/session-context/`, `tasks/route-locks/` | `pixel-task` and task bridge | Immutable source manifests, metadata digest cache, atomic provider/session task binding, bounded latest prompts for first-edit activation, and per-decision classification locks. |
| `task-hook-observations.json`, `task-hook-observations.lock` | CLI task bridge | Last real host invocation per provider; doctor reports observed activity separately from installation and trust. |
| `plan.json` | CLI `plan` | The persisted `pixel plan` checklist, so `--status`/`--done`/`--prune` survive a re-plan. |
| `workspace.json` | CLI `workspace` | The registered member repositories. |
| `config.yaml` (legacy `config.json`) | CLI `config` | Repository-level settings over `~/.pixel/config.yaml` (`pixel config edit --repo`). |
| `pi-policy.jsonl` | Pi extension (`pi-pixel.ts`) | The Pi harness's policy decisions ([docs/pi-harness.md](docs/pi-harness.md)). |

The prompt-submit hook emits a `[PIXEL:TASK_CONTEXT]` fact packet only when a
compatible warm daemon can serve fresh `targets_facts`; the packet is bounded,
declares its snapshot identity, and is omitted rather than partially rendered
on timeout or unavailable/stale facts. It is evidence and candidate entry
points, never an action recommendation or a read/edit boundary. The hook also
emits a `[PIXEL:TASK_BOUNDARY]` notice and reads
`.pixel/actions.jsonl`, then `~/.pixel/actions.jsonl`, to spot a task that
just ended. On Claude Code it also writes the task-runtime packet above. It
never rejects a prompt: every failure path exits 0 and the prompt proceeds.

Machine-wide:

- `~/.local/share/pixel/flows/`: saved flows (`pixel-flow`, `$PIXEL_FLOW_DIR`
  overrides).
- `~/.local/share/pixel/recall/` and `~/.local/share/pixel/models/`: the
  recall corpus (`$PIXEL_RECALL_DIR` overrides) and the embedding models,
  downloaded once from Hugging Face on `pixel recall setup`.
- `~/.local/state/pixel/sniper/<project key>/`: the `pixel-session` error sink
  (`errors-v1.sqlite` plus a `project.json` naming the root);
  `$PIXEL_SNIPER_STATE_ROOT` overrides the state root.
- `~/.local/state/pixel/` (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/pixel`): `pixel-ops` crash-safety
  state, keyed by a sha256 of the repository: `journals/`, `snapshots/`,
  `publish-recovery/` and `locks/<hash>.lock/owner.json` (the lock alone is
  keyed by the canonical git common directory, so every worktree shares it). Guarded git
  mutations write nothing under `.pixel/` except the two entries above.
- `~/.local/state/pixel/pr-swarm/`: the repo-local `pr-swarm` reconciler's
  state — `reconcile.log`, `lock/`, `resolve.tsv`, `last-run.jsonl` and
  `watch.pid` (the `watch` loop's claim, the authority on whether one runs) —
  written by `scripts/pr-swarm.sh`, not by any `pixel` crate
  (`.agents/rules/pr-swarm.md`). The pane set itself is derived from rmux
  pane titles, not from these files.
- Daemon socket and pid: `$TMPDIR` on macOS, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` on Linux
  (else `~/.cache/pixel/sockets/`), named
  `pixel-<xxh3 of canonical repo path>.sock`, `.pid` and `.lock`.

## Daemon and wire contract

`pixel-daemon` exposes one function that matters: `Service::handle(Op) ->
Envelope<Value>`. The Unix-socket daemon reads one JSON `Op` per line and
writes one JSON `Envelope` line back. Request handling is single-threaded; an
accept thread and a `notify` watcher feed one channel. The watcher debounces
filesystem events and refreshes the index and graph for changed files. The
daemon exits after thirty minutes idle.

Two version numbers exist and must not be conflated:

- `pixel_proto::ENVELOPE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`: the envelope schema (`protocol`
  field), currently 1.
- `pixel_daemon::api::PROTOCOL_VERSION`: the socket request/response format.
  Bump it when an older daemon process could not safely serve a newer CLI.
  The CLI pings first and compares.

The envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "op": "search",
  "protocol": 1,
  "requestId": "…",          // optional
  "snapshot":   { "head": "…", "branch": "…", "dirty_count": 0 },   // `dirty: [paths]` on inspect/review only
  "epistemics": { "closed_world": false, "lower_bound": true, "staleness_ms": 0, "basis": "…" },
  "budget":     { "byteCap": 262144, "used": 0, "truncated": false },   // + `cursor` when paged
  "result":     { … },        // present when ok
  "error":      { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "…" },   // present when !ok
  "warnings":   []
}
```

`requestId` and `budget` are part of the schema but no response is built
with them yet, so their absence means "not reported". The caps that bite
today report themselves inside the op's own result (`byte_cap`,
`truncated`, `next_cursor`, `next_offset`) or as envelope `warnings`.
`error.code` is the code the daemon classified the message into; the
variants no producer reaches are listed on `pixel_proto::ErrorCode`.

Invariants enforced by `Service::handle`:

- Success carries `result`, failure carries `error`. Never both.
- Every retrieval op (`search`, `resolve`, `targets`, `impact`, `uses`,
  `trace`, `changes`, `context`, `symbol`, `processes`, `clusters`, `plan`) gets an
  `epistemics` object. Ops that hit a cap name it in `basis` and mirror it as
  a warning. Ops that attested nothing get a conservative not-closed-world
  default instead of an implied claim of completeness.
- Retrieval ops and git-state ops (`inspect`, `review`, `diff`, `status`,
  `changes`) get a `snapshot` so the caller can correlate the answer with the
  working tree it was computed against. Only `inspect` and `review` carry the
  `dirty` path list; every other op ships `dirty_count` instead
  (`SnapshotInfo::compact`), so an untracked `vendor/bundle` of 15 000 paths
  does not inflate a `symbol` answer to 240 KB.

Adding an op is one variant on `pixel_proto::Op`, one arm in
`Service::dispatch` and one entry in `pixel_proto::SESSION_CAPABILITIES`.
Unit tests in `pixel-proto` check both: `op_name_matches_serde_tag` (the
`Op::op_name` of every variant is its serde tag) and
`session_capabilities_track_every_real_op` (the capability list and the enum
agree).

## Request path from the CLI

1. `main.rs` parses argv with clap. Commands that need the repository call
   `execute(path, Op, no_daemon)`. A command may compose several ops:
   `run-recipe --kind locate` calls `execute` once per op (resolve, a context
   per target, callers, file targets on a miss), never a CLI subprocess, so
   the daemon and in-process paths give the same answer; it compares the
   responses' snapshots and states a mismatch as a limit.
2. `execute` discovers the repo root, then tries the daemon: connect to the
   socket, ping (5 s timeout), and send the op. If no daemon answers, or one
   answers on an older `PROTOCOL_VERSION` (it is shut down first), it spawns
   `pixel daemon start <root> --foreground` in the background and polls the
   socket for up to five seconds. A daemon on a newer protocol is left alone
   and the command runs in process. `PIXEL_DAEMON_AUTO_START=0`, or
   `daemon_auto_start: false` in the config, disables the spawn.
3. If the daemon path fails, the CLI opens `Service` in-process and calls
   `handle` directly. Both paths return the same `Envelope`.
4. `unwrap_response` turns a failure envelope into an `Err(message)` that
   `main` prints to stderr with exit code 1. Under `--json` the CLI also
   answers on stdout with the failure envelope (`ok: false`, `error.code`,
   the same message) — classified by the daemon's `failure_response`, so a
   CLI-side failure carries the same code as a daemon one — unless the
   command owns stdout (`search-like-rg`, hooks, the statusline) or already
   wrote part of an answer (`check-release --json`). For a success envelope it
   takes `result` and folds `epistemics`, `snapshot`, and `warnings` into it
   without clobbering same-named keys the op emitted.
5. `print_data` serializes the result. With `--json` it is compact on one
   line, otherwise pretty. A global 256 KB cap protects the agent's context
   window (`PIXEL_OUTPUT_CAP_BYTES=<bytes>` overrides it, `0` lifts it). A
   `--json` answer over the cap is cut structurally: the largest arrays are
   shortened, every other field survives, and the object gains
   `truncated: true`, `cap_bytes` and `truncated_arrays` (path, kept,
   total). Only when no array trimming can fit the cap does the output fall
   back to a `{truncated, cap_bytes, note, partial}` wrapper. Human notes
   such as graph-build announcements and lower-bound caveats go to stderr,
   never stdout.

So the CLI's `--json` output is the envelope's `result` with the honesty
fields merged in, not the raw envelope. Anything that needs the full
envelope talks to the daemon socket directly.

## Indexes and freshness

- The text index is git-anchored: base shards correspond to a commit, delta
  shards to changes since, and an overlay covers the dirty working tree.
  `pixel status` reports whether each layer is fresh.
- The graph is built lazily on the first graph command and updated per file
  by the daemon watcher. Without a daemon (CI, `PIXEL_DAEMON_AUTO_START=0`,
  a copied `.pixel/`), the first graph command after an edit compares the
  tree's per-file content hashes with the stored ones in one walk and
  re-extracts only the added/edited files, drops the removed ones and
  re-resolves the calls that targeted them (`pixel_graph::build::tree_delta`
  / `apply_tree_delta`). A full rebuild remains the fallback when the db has
  no freshness signature or when the drift exceeds
  `PIXEL_GRAPH_INCREMENTAL_MAX_PCT` percent of the indexed files (default
  `20`; `0` always rebuilds). The answer's `graph_build` says which path ran
  (`incremental`, `changed_files`, `removed_files`, or `reason`), and the
  stderr notice reads `updated graph.db for N changed file(s)`, `built
  graph.db on first use`, or `rebuilt graph.db: <reason>` (the file on disk
  is `graph.v2.db`). Call edges carry a resolution tier, and
  analyses report a lower bound when same-name call sites stay unresolved.
- The `graph` op rebuilds from scratch by default (`rebuild-graph`,
  `prepare-repo --rebuild-graph`). With `"if_stale": true` (a request field
  that defaults to `false` and is sent only when set, so an older daemon
  ignores it and rebuilds), it takes the same keep / update / rebuild
  decision as the first graph command above; `prepare-repo` sends it. A
  `graph` answer from a daemon that knows the field carries `build`
  (an older one sends none, and `prepare-repo --json` then shows
  `timings.graph.build: null`): `{"mode": "fresh"}`, `{"mode":
  "incremental", "changed_files", "removed_files"}` or `{"mode": "full",
  "reason"}` (`requested` for an explicit rebuild), and `phases`: the full
  build's phase timings plus `publish_ms` (and `check_ms` when `if_stale`
  chose the rebuild), or `check_ms` (the walk that chose) and `apply_ms` for
  a kept or updated graph. `prepare-repo --json`
  moves both into `timings.graph`, beside `timings.index` (how each index
  layer was obtained) and `timings.total_ms`.
- History facts are ingested by a dedicated low-priority thread. Queries
  never wait on ingest; they answer from what is already in `history.db` and
  carry its `index_state` (`diffs_evicted`, `diff_coverage_since`). Diff text
  is bounded by an age window (`PIXEL_HISTORY_WINDOW_DAYS`, default 365) and
  a size budget (`PIXEL_HISTORY_BUDGET_MB`); commit metadata is never
  evicted. Both compare `unixepoch(committed_at)`, the author date, so a
  date whose offset SQLite cannot read (git prints `+518:00` for an object
  holding `+51800`) is stored as the same instant in UTC
  (`normalize_committed_at`). So a `file-history --file` answer is complete once phase A is,
  while a `file-history --token` answer only sees indexed diffs and says
  what it missed in `coverage` (`pixel_facts::lifecycle::DiffCoverage`):
  `lower_bound` when any commit's diff is pending or evicted (more touches
  may exist), `first_seen_exact` when none of them was authored at or
  before `first_seen`, and a `note` with the `git log --reverse -S` command
  that checks the full history. A token found nowhere carries the same
  block.

## Agent integration

The provider-neutral task layer lives above retrieval. `run-hook task-event`
normalizes Claude, Codex and Pi events into `task_bridge`; it never changes
the retrieval daemon's wire protocol. Global Claude/Codex installation owns
one native lifecycle registration; Pi's project extension owns its lifecycle.
A project-only native install still relies on the global lifecycle layer.
Foreign hooks and trust settings are preserved. Doctor distinguishes registered
hooks from actual observations; neither establishes complete host coverage.

`pixel-task::policy` decides edit/completion eligibility from the contract and
current source. CLI `task_prepare` bundles scope, bounded impact and test
suggestions. Unknown graph coverage requires explicitly configured conservative
checks. Scope is advisory, and static lower bounds never establish absence of
consumers. Source changes invalidate preparation/review and make check receipts
stale. Checks run in private materialized source workspaces. Unsupported source
dependencies remain blocked rather than silently omitted.

The bridge binds by worktree, provider and session, with Pi branch bindings
carrying their task and attempt across forks. Automatic first-mutation fallback
creates evidence state but denies that triggering edit. Missing state denies
supported edits and verified completion while read-only and task-recovery
commands remain available. A missing completion requirement can trigger at most
three automatic corrections, and at most two for identical unresolved state;
cancellation ends correction. These are host-hook guarantees, not a sandbox for
arbitrary shell programs. A host stopping does not imply verified completion.

Routing uses only deterministic eligible actions. Optional warm local
classification ranks those actions with a 300 ms budget and caches one result
per decision input/policy/configuration. Classifier failure falls back to the
original order. Predictions cannot satisfy checks. See
[task contracts and evaluation](docs/task-optimizer.md) for configuration,
commands, migration and operational limits.

Task trajectory events live in the durable task journal. `actions.jsonl` remains
best-effort invocation accounting, with optional explicit task correlation.
Blocked/retried model requests count as work; coordinator and classifier calls
are separate. Missing host/child coverage produces a lower bound, never zero
work. `task replay` reads frozen policy frames without execution. Empirical regret
compares only matching, successful, completely observed attempts. The existing
`eval/score.py` and `eval/gate.py` own quality/turn regression gates; the controlled
container backend adds isolated three-arm trials, not a replacement arena.

A global `pixel install` deploys the bundled `pixel-agent-prompt.md` and the
short `pixel-subagent-prompt.md` under `~/.local/share/pixel/`, then wires
each agent through its own extension point:

- **Claude Code**: lifecycle hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
  `SessionStart` (injects the prompt, so every Claude process gets it,
  direct launches included), `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse` on `Edit`
  (dependants of the edit) and on the shell tool (the metrics relay), and
  `SessionStart` with matcher `compact` (post-compaction re-injection). No
  global `PreToolUse`: enforcement is repo-local. The retired `claude()`
  shell wrapper is removed from the login shell's profile, and `doctor`
  reports one that remains (`install.legacy-wrappers`). The hook does not
  reach sub-agents: a print-mode run passes the deployed sub-agent prompt
  with `--append-subagent-system-prompt-file` ([docs/manual-setup.md](docs/manual-setup.md)).
- **Codex**: the `developer_instructions` key, the `UserPromptSubmit`
  Pixel-first guidance, and the `PostToolUse` metrics hook
  (`$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json`, default `~/.codex/hooks.json`), detailed below.
- **Pi**: a short Pixel rule in `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. Its
  repository extension (installed by `--repo`) registers the structured
  `pixel` tool and applies the [pre-execution Pi policy](docs/pi-harness.md)
  at `tool_call` time.
- **OpenCode**, **Antigravity** (`~/.gemini/config`: plugin, config entry and
  `run-hook guard --provider antigravity` hook) and **zcode**
  (`~/.zcode/cli/config.json`: `run-hook guard --provider zcode`): only when
  that agent's configuration already exists.

Retrieval policy is advisory by default; `pixel config policy enforce` opts
into supported retrieval restrictions, `pixel config policy off` (or
`PIXEL_POLICY=off`) disables policy decisions and rewrites. Unknown shell
syntax remains native. Pi's task bootstrap and post-edit context are
independent of that setting and preserve original tool results. Install
preserves foreign agent settings and rule files: it only rewrites its own
managed blocks and hook entries.

`pixel install --repo <path>` writes the project-scoped guards instead; each
one that names this machine's binary is listed in the clone's `info/exclude`
so no machine path is committed:

| File | Agent | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Claude Code | `PreToolUse` `run-hook guard --provider claude` |
| `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/hooks.json` (+ backup sidecar) | Codex | `developer_instructions`, and the `composed-guard` `PreToolUse` group replaying pre-existing project hooks; skipped when the repository tracks `.codex/hooks.json` |
| `.devin/config.local.json` | Devin | `PreToolUse` rewrite, `PermissionRequest` retrieval approval, prompt-context and metrics hooks |
| `.pi/extensions/pixel-guard.ts` | Pi | the guard extension |
| a managed block in `AGENTS.md` | Codex, and any agent that reads `AGENTS.md` | the Pixel-first retrieval rule, which never blocks native tools; compared word by word, so a copy re-wrapped by hand is current and left as is |

`doctor` checks them under the `repo.*` ids. `install --repo` and `uninstall
--repo` also remove the MCP server entry releases up to 0.6.1 wrote into
`.warp/.mcp.json`, and `repo.warp-mcp` reports one still there.

Codex gets the prompt through `developer_instructions` in `~/.codex/config.toml`
(`$CODEX_HOME` honoured), the key it appends to its developer message while
keeping its own system prompt; `model_instructions_file` would replace that
system prompt (it becomes the base instructions). A config key reaches every
Codex front end (CLI, desktop app, extension, `spawn_agent` sub-agents) where
a shell function only fronts interactive shells, so there is no `codex`
function. Codex has no file-backed variant of the key: `install` embeds the
prompt as a TOML literal multi-line string between `<!-- pixel:managed:begin
-->`/`end` marker lines, rewriting only that key with `toml_edit` so the rest
of a file the desktop app also owns keeps its layout, refusing to touch a file
that does not parse, and keeping text outside the markers. `doctor`
(`install.codex-config`) compares the block with the bundled prompt; `uninstall`
removes the block, or the key when nothing else was in it. Pi reads
`~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` automatically; that file is shared the same way
(markers, text outside them kept, `install.pi-prompt` in `doctor`, block — not
the file — removed by `uninstall`), so a user's own pi instructions survive.
OpenCode — when `~/.config/opencode` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honoured) exists —
gets the prompt as a managed block in its global `AGENTS.md`, the one
mechanism both generations honour: v2 accepts the `instructions` config
field but never resolves it, and v1 reads the global AGENTS.md in the same
slot it would otherwise fill from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Because a *new*
file would shadow that v1 fallback, install seeds a created AGENTS.md with
the claude file's content — the winning file then carries everything the
shadowed one had, plus the pixel block (v2 has no fallback to shadow). The
same step sweeps `opencode.json` for two stale artifacts: `instructions`
entries naming the deployed prompt (dead on v2, a duplicate on v1) and
`plugin`/`plugins` entries whose `pixel.mjs` target no longer exists — a
guaranteed load failure; entries resolving to a real file are left alone.
A config that does not parse as strict JSON is skipped, not rewritten, and
never blocks the AGENTS.md write. `doctor`
(`install.opencode-agents-md`) verifies the block is current and skips
when OpenCode is absent; `uninstall` strips the block (deleting the file
when it held nothing else) and drops leftover instructions entries.

The hook entry points, all under `pixel run-hook` (alias `hook`), and where
`pixel install` registers them:

| Hook event | Command | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | `pixel run-hook session-start` | Injects the agent prompt and the capability block from the op registry. For Claude Code the prompt is fitted to the 10 000-character inline limit of a hook's context (`CLAUDE_INLINE_CONTEXT_LIMIT` in `guard.rs`): `DEFERRABLE_SECTIONS` come out first and a closing line names them and the deployed prompt's path. Global for Claude Code and for Devin's own protocol; in a session that only imports Claude's configuration (Devin's `read_config_from.claude`), the entry carries the short Pixel-first guidance and the capability block instead of the Claude prompt. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `pixel run-hook prompt-submit` | Task context/boundary detection and the task-intent verdict. Never rejects a prompt. The Claude task packet is written only in a Claude Code session, never in a session that only imports Claude's configuration (a `--provider claude` hook Devin re-runs from `~/.claude/settings.json` delivers target/boundary context alone). Codex carries an always-on Pixel-first guidance line ahead of any task context, but only in an indexed repository (a discovered root without a shard would make the same commands build a full index, so the guidance stays quiet there). Global for Claude Code, Codex, and Devin's own protocol. |
| `SessionStart` matcher `compact` (`PostCompaction` on Devin) | `pixel run-hook post-compaction` | Re-injects the active task evidence as additional context. A `--provider claude` entry re-run by an importing host exits without emitting: the session id it would read belongs to the other harness. |
| `PreToolUse` | `pixel run-hook guard` | Bounded compatible command routing; native fallback and host permissions remain authoritative. Repo-local (`--repo`) for Claude Code and Devin; global for Antigravity and zcode. |
| `PostToolUse` (Claude `Edit`) | `pixel run-hook post-tool-use` | After an edit, emits the dependants of what was just changed. |
| `PostToolUse` (Codex, Claude `Bash`, Devin `exec`) | `pixel run-hook metrics` | Codex tool results drop stderr, so the finalized invocation's 🟩 metrics line is re-emitted as `additionalContext` (Claude and Devin also get `systemMessage`/`additionalContext` output through the same relay, installed by `pixel install` and `pixel install --repo`; when the tool result already carries the box, Claude still receives it as `systemMessage` only while Codex and Devin stay silent) — correlated to the action record by cwd + argv, silent on any miss, and suppressed by the same `metrics` opt-out. An imported Claude entry re-run by an importing host exits without emitting, so it does not double Devin's own relay. |
| `PreToolUse` (Codex, `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json`, `--repo`) | `pixel run-hook composed-guard` | Runs a sealed install-time snapshot of a foreign hook before Pixel's Codex rewrite. |
| Native task lifecycle (Claude Code and Codex); Pi extension lifecycle | `pixel run-hook task-event --provider <host> --event <event>` | Binds coding objectives, gates edits, records tool outcomes, and bounds Stop correction. Global native hooks compose with existing hooks; Pi persists branch-local bindings. Once enforced, a task retains its gates if runtime settings change. |

`pixel doctor` checks current installation artifacts and distinguishes configured
or protocol-checked hooks from observed live execution.
Every check is listed in `pixel_install::doctor::CHECKS` with a stable id and
the command that repairs it (`pixel doctor --list`): `--only`/`--skip` select
by id or by group (`install.*`), and each yellow or red check reports that command as `fix`.
`install.claude-hooks` is also yellow when complete hooks run another binary than
the managed one doctoring them (a global `pixel-dev install`, a previous release's
path); a `pixel-dev` doctor never judges the home install.
`repo.claude-hooks` is yellow with no fix when a repository `install --repo`
prepared (its Pixel-first rule is there) has no guard because a hook of the
user's that also rewrites shell calls held it back: only the user can narrow
that hook's matcher or accept the missing guard, and the summary says both.
`--fix` runs them: `repair_plan` folds the flagged checks into one run of each
distinct catalogue command, in catalogue order, `run_repair` executes it with
the running binary, and the checks are re-run so each repair is judged
`fixed`, `not_converged` or `failed` from the new report, not from its exit
code. A command only one outcome names (the `rm` of an orphaned RTK backup)
is never run. The binary checks go beyond the artifact: `binary.shell-path`
asks the resolved login shell itself (or `--shell`) for `pixel`, because an
agent harness that inherits an environment where `pixel` is not a command
silently works without it. The exit code carries the verdict: 0 when no check reaches `--fail-on` (default `red`),
1 when one does, 2 when the checks could not run.

### Invocation accounting and chat delivery

`pixel-actionlog` owns local metrics, not a parallel observability engine. A
top-level invocation correlates outcome, measured elapsed duration and rendered
output bytes with a versioned native-workflow estimate. Existing logs remain
readable. No additional retrieval, native comparison command, model request, or
repository sweep is justified solely by metrics calculation.

The byte approximation is roughly one token per four UTF-8 bytes and includes
reporting overhead. Measured output covers rendered CLI stdout, CLI-owned diagnostics and top-level
errors, not lower-level library or subprocess streams. V1's fallback volume policies are 4 KiB per assumed distinct
returned file read and 1 KiB per native-command output. They are assumptions, not
measured averages. `workflow-v2` measures the one case it can: `list-signatures`
stands in for reading one whole file, so its baseline is that file's size (a
`stat`, no source read) with no assumed command, and the live line states
`full read N tok, pixel answer M tok (-X%)` from the file and the stdout answer
(`answer_bytes`), both floored bytes / 4 as in `scripts/bench-read-savings.sh`.
Records keep the version they were written with. Estimates consider only returned evidence/relationships and
represented native steps. Partial results remain partial; meaningless comparisons
are unavailable; zero and negative savings are retained. There is no external
telemetry, hidden reasoning estimate, or monetary claim.

Time accounting is separate from byte accounting. An optional `time_estimate`
records `estimator_version: sequential-v1`, `round_trip_ms`, `native_command_ms: 0`,
`sequential_steps`, and signed `saved_ms`. Legacy records lacking these fields
remain unavailable for time comparisons; they are not silently recalculated.
`pixel token-savings` adds `time_estimates` groups keyed by token/time estimator
versions, effective assumptions and coverage, preserving earlier summaries.

Time savings are a separate `sequential-v1` workflow estimate, not measured
LLM latency. Let `steps = native_commands + distinct_files`; relationships do
not add round trips. A zero-step baseline is unavailable; otherwise the estimate
in milliseconds is:

```text
max(steps - 1, 0) * round_trip_ms - measured_pixel_duration_ms
```

One shared initial LLM/tool round trip cancels. The default policy assumes
**2000 ms per sequential round trip** and **0 ms of native command execution**.
`PIXEL_METRICS_ROUND_TRIP_MS` overrides the round-trip assumption with an unsigned
integer number of milliseconds (zero is allowed); unset, invalid, non-UTF-8, or
overflowing values use 2000. These assumptions and the estimator version are
recorded with each new invocation, not applied retroactively to old records.
Batching or parallel native workflows may require fewer round trips: this is
not a measured end-to-end speedup or a guarantee. Negative time savings are
retained; missing evidence is unavailable, and capped comparisons are partial.

The authoritative `🟩 Pixel · ...` line distinguishes `tokens saved (workflow
estimate)` from seconds `saved (sequential estimate)`. Both labels mark partial
comparisons. Measured execution duration stays distinct from both estimates;
no extra model call or native benchmark is run to compute the time estimate.
A missing comparison is never a silently dropped row: it renders
`unavailable: <reason>` (no policy baseline, failed operation, a render-cap or
depth-cap refusal, an uninitialized accumulator, or a zero-step baseline), and
a baseline that saves nothing renders `no estimated … saving`. The reason is
recorded as `comparison_gap` — a zero-step baseline is the one inferred from
the recorded evidence at render time — so a replay of the record states the
same cause.

Ordinary CLI boundaries emit an authoritative metrics line on stderr after the
result/error without changing JSON stdout. On a failure the `pixel: <error>`
diagnostic is repeated after that line, so the last stderr line still names the
failure when a caller reads only the tail. `--metrics=off` and `PIXEL_METRICS=0`
disable live reporting (and the repeat), not local accounting. Metrics failures cannot change success or safety behavior.
Exact-output search compatibility, hooks, protocol streams and statuslines remain
untouched; a separate host-supported channel is required for their live relay.
Protected paths lacking output-volume capture retain unavailable volumes rather
than fabricate counts.

The active prompt instructs an agent to copy the exact line from the same tool-call
result once, skipping an invocation already relayed by the host. A global latest
record is unsafe under concurrency and must never be used. The installer provides
no native automatic chat transport; mock-wrapper tests prove prompt delivery and
stream/exit preservation, not actual model adherence or live-host duplicate
suppression. Chat relay remains a host-supported, separately verifiable boundary.

## Testing and gates

- Unit tests live next to the code in each crate. `pixel-daemon` tests build
  small git fixtures in a temp dir and call `Service::handle` directly.
- CLI integration tests in `crates/pixel/tests/cli/` (one binary, one module per file) invoke the built binary
  through `CARGO_BIN_EXE_pixel` against a temp fixture repo.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) classifies the diff first, so a job whose
  paths did not change skips its steps, then runs in parallel:
  - **Test + Format**: action-pin verification (`scripts/verify-action-pins.py`),
    `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo nextest run --profile ci`
    (`.config/nextest.toml`: one process per test, retry once but fail on
    flaky, kill after 180 s), `cargo test --doc`, a check that the tests left
    the checkout's `.pixel/actions.jsonl` alone, the `scripts/test-*.py`
    contract scripts (installer, gate runner, mutation pre-push, release
    prepare, Homebrew formula and Linux bottles, homebrew-core formula,
    nightly mutants, mutants
    config, action pins, clean), the
    pixel-retro lead-time contract (`.agents/skills/pixel-retro/test_lead_time.py`)
    and the Bun Pi-policy contract (`scripts/test-pi-policy.mjs`);
  - **Lint**: `cargo clippy --all-targets` with warnings denied, then
    `cargo check` of the two reduced feature lanes (`--no-default-features`,
    `model2vec` only);
  - **MSRV**, **Ranking gates** (the NDCG@10 bench in test mode) and
    **Dependency policy** (`cargo deny`).
- Other workflows: `mutants.yml` (the `Mutants in diff` gate on every pull
  request touching `crates/`, sharded), `mutants-nightly.yml` (a whole-tree
  rotation), `cross-build.yml` (the three release lanes), `release.yml`
  (which writes the formula and the Linux bottles with
  `scripts/homebrew-formula.py`, and the homebrew-core formula with
  `scripts/homebrew-core-formula.py`), `homebrew-core.yml` (that formula
  built from source, `brew test`, `brew audit --strict --new`, on macOS and
  Linux),
  `release-prepare-scope.yml` and `pages.yml` (the website).
- Local agent validation uses targeted checks during editing and the full
  gates once a reviewable unit is ready (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Agent validation
  workflow"). Background gates validate an unchanged checkout or a committed
  worktree snapshot with its own build output; results identify the SHA.
- Once an implementation unit is finished, the project rule in `AGENTS.md`
  applies: rebuild, reinstall the binary atomically, re-index, reinstall
  hooks, and run `pixel doctor`. Intermediate edits do not trigger this
  loop; a check that exercises new installed behavior needs it first, and
  later changes to the binary or installed rules require it again.

## Release gate

`pixel check-release <version|tag> [--repo <path>] [--json]`
(the `pixel-release` crate) runs in the first job of
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (`verify`, before its `cargo test`) and is a
maintainer's last local step: it
reads `Cargo.toml`, every member's manifest, `Cargo.lock` and
`CHANGELOG.md` and reports three checks (`cli-version`, `cargo-lock`,
`changelog`), exit 1 on any failure. Pure functions over file contents;
no git, no network.

## Build provenance

`crates/pixel/build.rs` captures the commit (`-dirty` when tracked files
were modified), target triple, rustc version and build date
(`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` honoured) at compile time and `pixel --version` prints
them under the version line (`pixel -V` stays one line). Every value falls
back to `unknown` rather than failing the build. The script re-runs when
`.git/HEAD`, the ref it points to (looked up in the worktree's git dir and
the common dir), the index, or `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` changes, so the flag
follows commits without a `cargo clean`.

## Build features

`pixel-cli` defaults to `fastembed` and `model2vec`. `fastembed` needs ONNX
Runtime and cannot build for musl, so Linux release binaries are built with
`--no-default-features --features model2vec`. `--no-default-features` alone
gives an offline-only binary with no semantic search.

One build-time switch sits beside the features: `PIXEL_UPDATE_CHECK=off`
(read with `option_env!` in `update_notice.rs`) builds a binary that never
checks for a release, prints the notice or offers to upgrade itself. The
homebrew-core formula (`scripts/homebrew-core-formula.py`) builds with it and
with `--no-default-features --features model2vec`, since homebrew-core builds
from source, owns updates, and refuses the prebuilt ONNX Runtime `fastembed`
downloads; every other build keeps the check.
