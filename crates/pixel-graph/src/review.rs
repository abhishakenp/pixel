//! `review-gate` — a deterministic pre-review pass over the working-tree
//! diff, or the branch merge-base diff on a feature branch.
//!
//! Reuses [`crate::changes::detect_diffs`] for the graph side (uncovered ranges,
//! suggested tests, change-set risk, the lower-bound envelope) and adds the
//! mechanical rules a code review would otherwise start from scratch on:
//! a changed symbol whose callers were not themselves changed
//! (`producer-reader-divergence`), and an added line that carries a
//! credential-shaped value or a secret-named assignment

//! onto findings (`uncovered-change`, `unanchored-symbol`,
//! `changed-symbol-without-test`, `risk-climb`,
//! `unresolved-callers-lower-bound`).
//!
//! Findings never carry the matched secret value, only the pattern class
//! and the anchor; every finding names the witness that established it, and
//! every cap the pass fires is named in the report's `caps` (the daemon
